The details of the three scenarios and how to resolve them are provided as follows.\r\n\r\n### Script reference\r\n\r\nIf the Bold Report Viewer or the Bold Report Designer scripts are not properly referred, then this issue can occur. Hence, you need to ensure that the Bold Reporting components scripts are properly referred within your application to resolve this issue.\r\n\r\n### Using Bold Reports along with EJ1 components\r\n\r\nHaving the Reporting components in both EJ1 and Bold Reports products, if you refer the common `ej.web.all.min.js` then you will face a conflict with Syncfusion Reporting components and Bold Reports, due to which this issue will occur. When this issue occurs under this scenario, you can refer to [How to use the Bold Reports along with EJ1 controls](https://help.boldreports.com/embedded-reporting/faq/bold-reports-with-ej1-controls/) to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\n### Jquery script reference order\r\n\r\nThe Bold Reporting components will get registered after the `jquery.min.js` is referred. Hence this issue can occur if the `jquery.min.js` is not referred or referred after the Bold Reporting components script references. To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the Bold Reporting components script references are referred only after the `jquery.min.js` reference.\r\n\r\n> If you are using the multiple `jquery.min.js` references in your application, then you need to refer the Bold Reporting components script references at the last node of the references so that the instance of the Reporting components gets properly registered.","description":"This section explains about how to resolve the Bold Report Viewer undefined issue in the application in which Bold Reports is used."}},"context":{}}
