The details of the two scenarios and how to resolve them are provided as follows.\r\n\r\n### Script reference\r\n\r\nIf the `bold.reports.common.min.js` or the `bold.reports.widgets.min.js` scripts are not properly referred, then this issue can occur. Hence, you need to ensure that these scripts are properly referred within your application, in order to resolve this issue.\r\n\r\n![EJ1 undefined](./images/ej-components-undefined.png)\r\n\r\n### Using Bold Reports along with EJ2 components\r\n\r\nThe Bold Reports uses the Syncfusion EJ1 components for internal, which uses the `ej` as reference. Hence, while using the EJ2 components along with bold reports `ejs` should be used as the reference to initialize the EJ2 components.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you are using the EJ2 grid component along with Bold Reports, then you need to initialize the grid component using the following code sample.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar grid = new ejs.grids.Grid({dataSource: data});\r\n```\r\n\r\n![EJ2 undefined](./images/ej2-components-undefined.png)\r\n\r\n### See also\r\n\r\n[How to resolve the Bold Reporting components undefined issue?](../resolve-bold-reporting-components-undefined-issue/)\r\n\r\n[How to use BoldReports ReportViewer with EJ2 controls?](./bold-reports-with-ej2-controls)\r\n\r\n[How to use BoldReports ReportViewer with EJ1 controls?](./bold-reports-with-ej1-controls)","description":"This section explains about how to resolve the EJ undefined issue in the application, in which Bold Reporting components are used."}},"context":{}}
