Bold Reports licensing requires internet connection for the license validation. So, you should ensure the firewall is not blocking the site [http://websiteapi.boldbi.com/](http://websiteapi.boldbi.com/) from your network for license validation. If you donâ€™t have the network problem, then you should ensure the license token registered, as properly with your application as explained in below documentation.\r\n\r\n[Register license token for an application](https://help.boldreports.com/report-viewer-sdk/licensing/online-license-token/)\r\n\r\n> Since, the process of our license validation will be at the startup of every application, you have to register the license in the startup of application. The internet license validation will be processed in the place of registering the license token only.\r\n\r\n### See Also\r\n\r\n[How to upgrade from Trial version after purchasing a license](https://help.boldreports.com/report-viewer-sdk/licensing/faq/how-to-upgrade-from-trial-version-after-purchasing-a-license/)\r\n[Where can I get a license token](https://help.boldreports.com/report-viewer-sdk/licensing/faq/where-can-i-get-a-license-token/)\r\n[Embedded reporting tools licensing version 1.2.x](https://help.boldreports.com/report-viewer-sdk/licensing/faq/v1.x/)","description":"This section explains about how to hide the error watermarks that are shown in the Bold Reporting components."}},"context":{}}
